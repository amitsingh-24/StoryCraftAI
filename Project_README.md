[![Open in Spaces](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/badges/resolve/main/open-in-hf-spaces-md-dark.svg)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/asr24/StoryCraftAI)

Learn how to automate story generation using deep learning and deploy a full-featured web application with CI/CD.

## Project Description

**StoryCraftAI** is an automatic story generation system built entirely from scratch using deep learning. This project covers the entire pipelineâ€”from scraping and preprocessing classic short stories to training various neural network architectures and generating creative narratives from a user-provided seed text.

### Key Features
- **Data Scraping & Preprocessing:**
  - Automatically scrapes classic short stories from [classicshorts.com](http://www.classicshorts.com/).
  - Cleans text by removing unwanted characters and tokenizes sentences into words.
- **Multiple Model Architectures:**
  - **GRU & LSTM:** Optimized for sequence prediction.
  - **Bidirectional Models:** (Bidirectional-LSTM and Bidirectional-GRU) Capture richer context.
  - **Hybrid Approaches:** Combine strengths of different models for better performance.
- **Training & Evaluation:**
  - Generates training sequences (50 words as input and 1 as output).
  - Tracks performance with accuracy and loss metrics.
  - Saves training history for visualization.
- **Interactive Web Application:**
  - Flask-based web interface for real-time story generation.
- **CI/CD & Deployment:**
  - Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces with continuous integration via GitHub Actions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later.
- Virtual environment (recommended).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StoryCraftAI.git
   cd StoryCraftAI
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download NLTK data:
   ```bash
   python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
   ```

5. Run the application locally:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Training the Models

### Pipeline Overview
- **Data Scraping:** Fetches stories from [classicshorts.com](http://www.classicshorts.com/).
- **Preprocessing:** Tokenizes text and creates sequences of 51 tokens (50 input, 1 target).
- **Model Building:** Supports architectures like `gru`, `lstm`, `bi_di_gru`, and `bi_di_lstm`.
- **Training:** Uses categorical crossentropy loss. Training logs and performance graphs are generated.

### Execution
Run the training scripts using Jupyter notebooks in the `Notebooks/` folder or directly from the command line. Save the trained model, tokenizer, and training history in the `Models/` directory.

## Deployment

### Using Docker
1. Build and run the Docker container locally:
   ```bash
   docker build -t storycraftai .
   docker run -p 7860:7860 storycraftai
   ```

### CI/CD on Hugging Face Spaces
- Configured for CI/CD using GitHub Actions. Every push to the `main` branch triggers an automated rebuild and redeployment.
